#IAM Implementation Portfolio

**Cohort:** SimplifyIAM Live Cohort 1  **Name:** Uzma Farooqui  **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/uzmafarooqui  **GitHub:** https://github.com/uzmafarooqui/IAM-portfolio  **Completed:** May 2026  **Status:** In progress

## What I Built
Over five live Saturday sessions I built a complete IAM environment from scratch using **midPoint**, **OpenLDAP**, and **Auth0**. The environment runs on a dedicated cloud server and replicates how IAM provisioning works in a real enterprise engagement.

This repository documents my configuration, screenshots, and decisions for each session. It is intended as portfolio evidence for IAM implementation roles.

## Environment

| Component | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **midPoint** | IGA platform - identity lifecycle, provisioning, reconciliation |
| **SimplifyHR (Flask)** | HR source of truth - simulates enterprise HRIS |
| **OpenLDAP** | Target directory - user accounts provisioned here |
| **Auth0** | Access management - OIDC and SAML federation |

## Session Deliverables

### Saturday 1 - Architecture and Environment
- Architecture diagram or description committed  
- Screenshot: midPoint Screens  
- Screenshot: SimplifyHR dashboard running  
- Screenshot: OpenLDAP screens and OU structure  

**What I built:**  
I deployed the core IAM architecture and confirmed midPoint could successfully read HR data and connect to OpenLDAP. This gave me a clean, working identity flow that sets the stage for joiner, mover, and leaver automation.

**Resume bullet:**  
Set up and tested the IAM lab stack, ensuring accurate identity flow from HR into LDAP before provisioning workflows.
